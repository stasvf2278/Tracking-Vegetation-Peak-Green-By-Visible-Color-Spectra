Project Name:

Tracking Vegetation Peak Green By Visible Color Spectra

Description:

This script takes visible light images (i.e. from any camera) and provides the means to crop the image to a desired section and then convert those color values to several color spectra systems (e.g. RGB, vNDVI) to track peak green in vegetation at a given location. This tool can also be used to track the presence of snow in images. These values are then plotted by date to show yearly variation.

Usage:

Note: Written in Pyton 3.6

Note: This script was written for Windows.

Note: Need to update directory paths as commented in script

Note: Will likely need to change cropping specifications in script

Installation:

This script is written in the main() feature.

Credits:

I, stasvf2278, wrote this script as volunteer to quantify and track changes in the peak greening of vegetation on a year-to-year basis.

This code is available to help other institutions track peak greening without infrared sensors required for use by standard NDVI methods.
